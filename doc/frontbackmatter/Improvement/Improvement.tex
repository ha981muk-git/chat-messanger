\section{Database}\label{sec:database}
In our project an array was used to store the data
but if the project needs to be improved, it would be very good and very helpful to use the database,
because the use of databases prevents redundancies \(multiple storage of the same information\) and
inconsistencies \(problems with updating multiple stored records\) in the data.
When using the database, the client information and its messages are stored permanently, so the
client has to register with the server only once, and then he has the possibility to log in.
On the other hand, client messages are automatically stored and always available.

Benefit of Using the DB:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Databases can easily handle multiple users.
    \item Databases are very reliable because they store information accurately.
    \item Databases avoid unnecessary information.
    \item Databases allow powerful and interesting information processing.
    \item Databases are extensible.
    \item Databases can handle large amounts of data
\end{itemize}
\noindent
Even if you don't need to process large amounts of data yourself (yet), databases are useful for
smaller amounts of data. With the capacity to handle so much data, a well-designed database can
serve you for many years as it grows with you.
