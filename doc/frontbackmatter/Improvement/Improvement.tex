\section{Database}\label{sec:database}
In our project an array was used to store the data
but if the project needs to be improved, it would be very good and very helpful to use the database,
because the use of databases prevents redundancies \(multiple storage of the same information\) and
inconsistencies \(problems with updating multiple stored records\) in the data.
When using the database, the client information and its messages are stored permanently, so the
client has to register with the server only once, and then he has the possibility to log in.
On the other hand, client messages are automatically stored and always available.

Benefit of Using the DB:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Databases can easily handle multiple users.
    \item Databases are very reliable because they store information accurately.
    \item Databases avoid unnecessary information.
    \item Databases allow powerful and interesting information processing.
    \item Databases are extensible.
    \item Databases can handle large amounts of data
\end{itemize}
\noindent
Even if you don't need to process large amounts of data yourself (yet), databases are useful for
smaller amounts of data. With the capacity to handle so much data, a well-designed database can
serve you for many years as it grows with you.

\section {Vidioconferenz }\label{sec:Vidioconferenz}
Video conferencing can be very important in our project in the future, because it has many advantages
 for companies and people, for example 
1-Video conferencing can easily overcome spatial distances. Location-independent communication
saves valuable time and long journeys, and can thus speed up workflows and decision-making processes
enormously.
2-The video conferencing is very helpful for people working abroad and also for students studying abroad.
so that you can contact with their families. 
You can add the ability of screen sharing for video conferencing, so that you can have multiple applications
in one application.
