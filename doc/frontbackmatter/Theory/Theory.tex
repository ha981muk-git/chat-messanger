    \section{Java}
    Java is one of the most popular programming language.It is develop by Oracle Corportation
    in May 23, 1995. It is also used to develop mobile apps, web apps, desktop apps, games and
    much more. It has helped to reduce costs, shortens development timeframes, drive innovation,
    and improve application services.

     There are five primary goals in the creation of the Java language.
     \begin{itemize}
        \item It must be simple, object-oriented, and familiar.
        \item It must be robust and secure.
        \item It must be architecture-neutral and portable.
        \item It must be interpreted, threaded and dynamic.
    \end{itemize}

    \section{Thread}
    A thread of execution is the smallest sequence of programmed instructions that can be managed 
    independently by a scheduler, which is typically a part of the operating system. The implementation
    of threads and processes differs between operating systems,but in most cases a thread is a component 
    of a process. The multiple threads of a given process may be executed concurrently 
    \(via multithreading capabilities\), sharing resources such as memory, while different processes do 
    not share these resources.

    A thread is a thread of execution in a program. The Java Virtual Machine allows an application to have
    multiple threads of execution running concurrently. Every thread has a priority. Threads with higher 
    priority are executed in preference to threads with lower priority.

    \section{Git}
    Git is an open source distributed version control system, mainly used for source code management, with
    an emphasis on speed. Git was initially designed and created by Linus Torvalds for Linux kernel development.
    Git operates on a decentralized architecture, so every Git working directory is a full-fledged repository
    with a complete history and full revision-tracking capabilities, and is not dependent upon network access or 
    a central server. Unlike popular non-distributed predecessors, such as Subversion and CVS, Git only needs a 
    central server for one thing: publishing changes to users of that server. You can equally share changes 
    directly with other people without the need to consult a central hub.

    \section{Gitlab}
    GitLab Inc. is an open-core company that provides GitLab, a DevOps software package that combines the
    ability to develop,secure, and operate software in a single application. The open source software project
    was created by Ukrainian developer Dmitriy Zaporozhets and Dutch developer Sytse Sijbrandij. Since its
    founding, GitLab Inc. has been centered around remote work. GitLab has an estimated 30 million registered 
    users, with 1 million being active licensed users.

    \section{Project}
    A project is well-defined task, which is a collection of several operations done in order to achieve a goal 
    Â \(for example, software development and delivery\).
    \medspace
    
    A Project can be characterized as:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Every project may has a unique and distinct goal.
        \item Project is not routine activity or day-to-day operations.
        \item Project comes with a start time and end time.
        \item Project ends when its goal is achieved hence it is a temporary phase in the lifetime of an organization.
        \item Project needs adequate resources in terms of time, manpower, finance, material and knowledge-bank.
    \end{itemize}

    A software Project is the complete procedure of software development from requirement gathering to testing and
    maintenance, carried out according to the execution methodologies, in a specified period of time to achieve 
    intended software product.
